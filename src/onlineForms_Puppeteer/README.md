# Online Form Field Extractor (Puppeteer)

This folder provides a Node.js-based service to extract form fields from any given URL using Puppeteer. It launches a headless Chrome browser, navigates to the provided URL, and extracts all form fields, including their labels, types, values, and validation constraints.

## Features

- **Dynamic Field Extraction:** Extracts form fields from fully rendered web pages, including those generated by JavaScript.
- **Comprehensive Field Data:** Captures field ID, name, type, label, value, required status, disabled status, and validation attributes.
- **Multi-Strategy Label Detection:** Uses a robust algorithm to identify field labels, handling various HTML structures and ARIA attributes.
- **Support for Multiple Field Types:** Handles input fields, select dropdowns, and textareas.
- **JSON Output:** Returns extracted form fields in a structured JSON format.
- **Blank Field Detection:** Identifies fields with empty values or unchecked checkboxes/radio buttons.

## Requirements

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Puppeteer (`npm install puppeteer`)

## Limitations

- Authentication: Cannot access forms behind login screens without credentials
- Dynamic Fields: May not capture fields that appear based on user interactions
- Anti-Bot Protection: Some websites actively block automated browsers
- Performance: Browser-based extraction is resource-intensive for high-volume processing
